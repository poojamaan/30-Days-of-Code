Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String. Then you must read 3 lines of input from stdin and initialize your 3 variables. Finally, you must use the ++ operator to perform the following operations:

Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
Note: If you are using a language that doesnâ€™t support using ++ for string concatenation (e.g.: CC), you can just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor must be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, i.
The second line contains a double, d.
The third line contains a string, s.

Output Format

Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.

Solution GIven here: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read input from stdin.
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our variable, inputString.
        String inputString = scan.nextLine();

        // Close the scanner object, because we've finished reading
        // all of the input from stdin needed for this challenge.
        scan.close();

        // Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
        System.out.println("Hello, World.");

        // Print the contents of inputString to stdout.
        System.out.println(inputString);
    }
}
